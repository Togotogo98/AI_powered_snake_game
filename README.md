# AI-Powered Snake Game
This project is an AI-driven Snake game developed using Python and PyGame, integrating deep reinforcement learning techniques to create an intelligent and adaptive snake bot.

## Key Features:
- AI with Q-Learning: The snake learns optimal strategies using Q-learning with epsilon-greedy exploration.
- Replay Memory: Implements experience replay to improve the stability and efficiency of the learning process.
- Visual Training Progress: Monitors the botâ€™s training progress with detailed visualizations using Matplotlib.
- Human vs AI Comparison: Features both heuristic-based and reinforcement learning-based snake bots for performance benchmarking.
- Customizable Gameplay: Offers flexibility to tweak game parameters for testing and observing different AI behaviors.

## Tech Stack:
- Language: Python
- Libraries: PyGame for game development, PyTorch for reinforcement learning, Matplotlib for visualization.

This project showcases the power of reinforcement learning in creating intelligent agents capable of learning and adapting to dynamic environments.
